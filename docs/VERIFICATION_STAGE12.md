# Stage 12 — Verification: daily cron ingestion

> **Purpose.** Prove the Stage 12 claims against the real project:
>
> 1. **The cron endpoint cannot be triggered by anyone but Vercel** — and fails
>    closed if `CRON_SECRET` is unset.
> 2. **No new attack surface** — the cron writes as a least-privilege bot through
>    the same RLS gate as the admin button. No service-role, no public write RPC.
> 3. **A source outage no longer delists that source's roles** (the Stage 8 bug).
> 4. **Every run is logged and visible** in `sync_runs` + the admin card.
>
> **Run status: 🟢 PASSED — Stage 12 is closed.** Code verified 2026-07-15; live
> verified 2026-07-16 against production (`main` @ `3b0d565`); the first unattended
> nightly cron fired **2026-07-17 03:27 UTC** (§f4). Sections a–e, f1 and f4 passed.
> Only f2–f3 (admin card `manual` trigger; the `events` row) remain unrun — both
> are cosmetic next to f4, which was the load-bearing claim.

## 0. Setup — the user must do this first, in this order

The code **cannot work** until all three are done. `sync_runs` writes are swallowed
by design, so a missing migration shows up as a quiet "No sync has run yet" rather
than an error.

1. **Create the bot user.** Supabase → Authentication → Users → **Add user** →
   email + password, **Auto Confirm User ON**. Suggested:
   `shwetaswain13november+ingestbot@gmail.com` (the `+alias` trick from Stage 8 —
   it lands in the same inbox but is a distinct identity).
2. **Run the migration.** Open `scripts/stage12-cron-ingestion.sql`, replace
   **`BOT_EMAIL_HERE`** with that email, run it in the SQL editor.
3. **Set env vars** in **Vercel** (Production) *and* `.env.local`:
   `CRON_SECRET` (any long random string), `INGEST_BOT_EMAIL`,
   `INGEST_BOT_PASSWORD`.

> **Vercel Hobby:** crons fire **only from production deployments**, and a daily
> schedule fires *within* the given hour, not on the minute. So the nightly run
> only starts once this branch is merged to `main` and deployed.

> **Stage 11 lesson:** the migration and the deploy are **one atomic change**. This
> migration is additive (new predicate, widened policies, new table), so it is safe
> to run before the deploy — but the stage is not done until both are live and
> verified against the **production URL**, not localhost.

## a. The cron auth gate ✅ PASSED (2026-07-15, local)

All three branches must be distinguished. If every request returns 401, you have
**not** proven the gate opens — only that it rejects.

| # | Request | Expected | **Actual** |
|---|---------|----------|-----------|
| a1 | No `Authorization` header, `CRON_SECRET` **unset** | `401 {"error":"Not configured."}` | ✅ fail-closed — a missing env var never leaves the endpoint open |
| a2 | No header, `CRON_SECRET` **set** | `401` | ✅ |
| a3 | **Wrong** secret | `401 {"error":"Unauthorized."}` | ✅ the **comparison** branch, distinct from a1's fail-closed |
| a4 | **Correct** secret (bot env absent) | `500 {"error":"Server misconfigured."}` | ✅ **auth passed** and stopped at the bot env — this is what proves the gate opens |

```powershell
curl.exe -s http://localhost:3000/api/cron/ingest
curl.exe -s http://localhost:3000/api/cron/ingest -H "Authorization: Bearer wrong"
curl.exe -s http://localhost:3000/api/cron/ingest -H "Authorization: Bearer $env:CRON_SECRET"
```

## b. The Stage 8 expiry bug ✅ PASSED (unit, 2026-07-15)

`npx tsx scripts/tests/skipSources.test.ts` · `npx tsx scripts/tests/pipeline.test.ts`

| # | Assertion | **Actual** |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| b1 | A skipped source is **never** expired — `classifyExpiry(existing, ["greenhouse:g1"], ["adzuna"])` omits `adzuna:a5` | ✅ |
| b2 | A source that errored (`ok: false`) is skipped + warned | ✅ |
| b3 | Circuit breaker: `fetched = 0` while `previouslyLive > 0` → skip + warn | ✅ |
| b4 | Circuit breaker does **not** fire for a genuinely new source (`previouslyLive = 0`) | ✅ |
| b5 | Already-dead rows aren't re-expired (honest `expired` count) | ✅ |
| b6 | Richer JD wins across sources; **ties fall back to source rank** | ✅ (the fallback is load-bearing — stable sort would let input order decide) |

Also: `tsc --noEmit` clean · `next build` clean, `ƒ /api/cron/ingest` registered ·
all 5 test suites green.

---

## c. Live cron run ✅ PASSED (2026-07-16, production)

| # | Action | Expected | **Actual** |
|---|--------|----------|-----------|
| c1 | `curl` prod with **no** header, then a **wrong** secret | `401` both | ✅ both `401 {"error":"Unauthorized."}` |
| c2 | `curl` prod with the **correct** secret | `200` + summary | ✅ `200` — `run_id a3a8847b`, `added 0, updated 71, expired 0`, all three sources `ok` |

> **c1 also proved the Vercel env var** without anyone handling the secret. The
> route returns `"Not configured."` when `CRON_SECRET` is unset and `"Unauthorized."`
> only when a real comparison fails (`route.ts:23-29`). Production returned
> `"Unauthorized."` → the secret **is** set in Vercel Production. Distinguishing
> the two 401 bodies is the whole point of splitting those branches.

```powershell
curl.exe -s -w "`nHTTP %{http_code}`n" https://product-compass-lilac.vercel.app/api/cron/ingest -H "Authorization: Bearer $env:CRON_SECRET"
```

## d. No new attack surface ⬜ PENDING (Stage 11's three-leg method)

Control + attack + app-path. **The control is what makes `[]` meaningful** — without
it, `[]` could just mean "empty table" (the trap from `PAST_MISTAKES.md`).

**✅ PASSED (2026-07-16, live anon key from the terminal).**

| # | Request (anon key, from the terminal — **not** the SQL editor) | Expected | **Actual** |
|---|---------|----------|-----------|
| d1 | **CONTROL** `roles?select=id&limit=1` | rows → the key works | ✅ `[{"id":"ff408af1-…"}]` `200` |
| d2 | **ATTACK** `sync_runs?select=*` | `[]` → invisible to the client | ✅ `[]` — meaningful *because* d1 returned a row |
| d3 | **ATTACK** `roles` insert with the anon key | denied → RLS still the gate | ✅ `401` `42501 new row violates row-level security policy for table "roles"` |
| d4 | Confirm **no** `ingest_upsert_roles` RPC exists | 404 → no public write RPC | ✅ `404` |

## e. The bug fix, live ✅ PASSED (2026-07-16) — the most valuable check

Simulate a source outage and prove roles survive it:

1. Unset `ADZUNA_APP_ID` in `.env.local` (→ `fetchAdzuna` returns
   `"adzuna: keys not configured"`).
2. Run the route locally with the correct secret.
3. In SQL: `select source, fetched, ok, expired, warnings from sync_runs order by run_at desc limit 3;`

**Expected:** `adzuna` row shows `ok = false`, a warning, and **`expired = 0`** —
the outage did **not** delist Adzuna's roles. Restore the key afterwards.
*(Before this stage, that same outage would have flipped `is_live = false` on all
~44 Adzuna roles.)*

**Actual — the outage did not delist anything:**

```
{"added":0,"updated":29,"expired":0,
 "bySource":{"greenhouse":{"fetched":29,"ok":true},
             "lever":{"fetched":0,"ok":true},
             "adzuna":{"fetched":0,"ok":false}},
 "errors":["adzuna: keys not configured"],
 "warnings":["adzuna: fetch failed — expiry skipped (42 live rows kept)"]}
```

`sync_runs` agreed: `adzuna | 0 | false | 0 | {"adzuna: fetch failed — …"}`.
Greenhouse expired 0 in the same run because all 29 of its roles came back — the
skip is **per source**, not a global off-switch. Adzuna key restored afterwards;
the next production run showed `adzuna 45 fetched, ok: true, expired 0`.

> The `42` in the warning is Adzuna's `previouslyLive`, counted from the DB before
> the expiry pass (`pipeline.ts:107-108`) — so the number in the warning and the
> rows left on disk are the same population.

## f. Logging + admin card 🟡 f1 PASSED · f2–f4 open

| # | Action | Expected | **Actual** |
|---|--------|----------|-----------|
| f1 | `/admin` as an admin | **Last sync** card: per-source `fetched`/`expired`, `ok` ticks, relative time, `cron` vs `manual` | ✅ `2m ago · cron`, greenhouse 29/0, lever 0/0, adzuna 45/0, "0 added · 71 updated" — an exact match for run `a3a8847b`, i.e. the summary and the logged row agree |
| f2 | Click **Sync jobs now**, reload `/admin` | card updates, `trigger = manual` | ⬜ not yet run |
| f3 | `select name, props from events where name = 'ingest_run' order by created_at desc;` | rows with `{trigger, added, updated, expired, sources_ok, sources_failed}`, **no PII** | ⬜ not run |
| f4 | After the first nightly cron | a `trigger = 'cron'` row appears | ✅ **PASSED** — `2026-07-17 03:27:32+00`, all three sources `ok`, greenhouse 29 / lever 0 / adzuna 46 |

> **What actually proved f4 was the TIMESTAMP, not the trigger column.** `trigger =
> 'cron'` is written by the *route*, so our own §c2 curl produced a `cron` row too
> (`2026-07-16 13:57:58`). The claim "Vercel calls the endpoint unattended" is only
> settled by a row appearing at **03:27 UTC** with nobody at a terminal — and by
> adzuna moving 45 → 46, i.e. it pulled fresh data rather than replaying ours.
> `03:27` (not `03:00`) is Vercel Hobby behaving as documented: a daily cron fires
> *within* the scheduled hour, not on the minute. Don't read the drift as a fault.
